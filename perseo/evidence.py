"""CTA evidence table access with HPA tissue-restriction columns.

The evidence table contains one row per CTA gene (358 genes from multiple
source databases), annotated with Human Protein Atlas v23 protein and RNA
tissue expression data and the tiered filter results.

    Columns
    -------
    Symbol, Aliases, Full_Name, Function, Ensembl_Gene_ID,
    source_databases, biotype, Canonical_Transcript_ID
        Gene identity fields.
    protein_reproductive : bool or "no data"
        True if all IHC-detected tissues (excluding thymus) are in
        {testis, ovary, placenta}.
    protein_thymus : bool or "no data"
        True if protein detected in thymus.
    rna_reproductive : bool
        True if every tissue with >=1 nTPM (excluding thymus) is in
        {testis, ovary, placenta}.
    rna_thymus : bool
        True if thymus nTPM >= 1.
    protein_reliability : str
        Best HPA antibody reliability for this gene: "Enhanced",
        "Supported", "Approved", "Uncertain", or "no data".
    protein_strict_expression : str
        Semicolon-separated list of tissues where protein is detected
        (excluding thymus), or "no data" / "not detected".
    rna_reproductive_frac : float
        Fraction of total nTPM (excluding thymus) in core reproductive
        tissues, computed from raw nTPM values.
    rna_reproductive_and_thymus_frac : float
        Same but with thymus nTPM added to numerator and denominator.
    rna_deflated_reproductive_frac : float
        (1 + repro_deflated) / (1 + total_deflated) where each tissue
        is deflated via max(0, nTPM - 1).  The +1 pseudocount prevents
        0/0 for very-low-expression genes.
    rna_deflated_reproductive_and_thymus_frac : float
        Same but with thymus deflated nTPM added to the reproductive
        numerator.
    rna_80_pct_filter, rna_90_pct_filter, rna_95_pct_filter : bool
        Whether deflated reproductive fraction >= 80/90/95%.
    filtered : bool
        Final inclusion flag with tiered RNA thresholds based on protein
        antibody reliability.  True when protein is reproductive-only
        (or absent) and deflated RNA fraction meets the tier threshold:
        - Enhanced -> RNA >=80%
        - Supported -> RNA >=90%
        - Approved -> RNA >=95%
        - Uncertain or no protein data -> RNA >=99%
        Genes with protein in non-reproductive tissues always fail.
        Non-protein-coding genes (biotype != protein_coding) always fail.
    rna_max_ntpm : float
        Maximum nTPM across all tissues for this gene.
    never_expressed : bool
        True if no HPA protein data AND maximum RNA nTPM < 2.
